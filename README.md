# Stroop-Interference-Effect-on-Eye-Movement-Experiment
The goal of this experiment is to see how eye movement (saccades) when showing words of the color of the rainbow with their congruent color (for example, an orange word with an orange color is displayed) differs from that when showing words of the color of the rainbow with an incongruent color (for example, an orange word with a green color is displayed). We predict that saccades will be greater and more erratic when words with incongruent colors are shown because the brain has to process more. 
We will test our hypothesis by running our matlab programs. 

Our first program, stroopeffect.m, is the actual experiment. For 6 iterations, it shows each of the six colors of the rainbow with their congruent colors in a random order. The next six iterations show a random word with a random incongruent color. The program records the word and color of the word in a table. Right after each word and color display, the user is required to press the right key (the user has to press a key corresponding to the color of the word (for example, the right key when red with an orange color is displayed is 'o')) but the program will take any key input. This is where additional data is recorded. The program records the user's reaction time (the time it takes for the user to press a key right after a word and color display) and whether the user pressed the right key or not. Right after the user presses a key, a central black dot (called a fixation point) is shown for one second to stabilize the eye movements of the user for the next word and color display. Throughout the program, we will use an eye tracker to record the movements of the eye movements of the user.The eye tracker gives and EDF file which is converted to an .asc file. The .asc file contains the time of recording in column one, the x position of the left eye in column two, the y position of the left eye in column three, the x position of the right eye in column five, and the y position of the right eye in column six. We want to graph the eye movements during the times in between when the word and color displays happen and when the user presses a key. stroopeffect.m determines these time intervals by putting markers in the .asc corresponding to the time a word and color display shows and the time when the user presses a key after the word and color display shows for each of the 12 word and color displays.

Our analysis of the eye movements is done our three other programs: driver.m and analysis.m. analysis.m is responsible for graphing the saccades, pursuits and blinks for any congruent or incongruent color and word displays for the right eye. driver.m is overarching and is responsible for graphing 12 figures (6 for the congurent colors and 6 for the incongruent colors). It does this by searching for the markers in the .asc file and graphing data for the time interval determined by the markers. Since there are 2 markers for each word and color display and 12 word and color displays, 12 plots are created. 

Hopefully, we will see how the eye tracker's recordings differ when words with congruent colors are shown and when words with incongruent colors are shown.
