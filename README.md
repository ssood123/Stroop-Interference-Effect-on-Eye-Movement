# Stroop-Interference-Effect-on-Eye-Movement-Experiment
The goal of this program is to see how eye movement (saccades) when showing words of the color of the rainbow with their congruent color (for example, an orange word with an orange color is displayed) differs from that when showing words of the color of the rainbow with an incongruent color (for example, an orange word with a green color is displayed). We predict that saccades will be greater and more erratic when words with incongruent colors are shown because the brain has to process more. We will test our hypothesis by running our matlab program (called stroopeffect.m) with an eye tracker and seeing how the eye tracker's recordings differ when words with congruent colors are shown and when words with incongruent colors are shown.

In addition, we will record the user's reaction time (the time it takes for the user to press a key right after a word with a certain color is displayed) and whether the user pressed the right key or not (the user has to press a key corresponding to the color of the word (for example, the right key when red with an orange color is displayed is 'o'). We will perform statistical analysis on these two variables.
